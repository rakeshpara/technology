        Privacy policies are legal documents that inform users about how their personal data is handled and what rights they can exercise  over their data, such as the right to data deletion. <br> They will typically contain details about the type of personal information  collected, who it’s shared with, and how it’s stored. <br><br><br>

To further elaborate, a privacy policy: <br>

Is a legal document that helps businesses comply with privacy laws and consumer protection laws 
Discloses the ways the user’s personal data will be collected, managed, and used 
Explains for what purpose that data will be collected <br>
Reminds the user of their data privacy rights to consent and access of their data 
Discloses whether or not data will be sold to third parties (which must be done with consent) <br>
Users don’t need to consent to privacy policies because they are not a legal  contract between the website and the user. <br>Instead, a privacy  policy is an informative document that helps businesses comply with privacy laws by being transparent about they collect and use personal data. <br><br><br>

Privacy policies are required by the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), <br>the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), and California  Online Privacy Protection Act (CalOPPA), three major data privacy regulations. <br>

Other regional laws may also require you generate a privacy policy, such as the Colorado Privacy Act, the Virginia Consumer Data Protection  Act, or the Connecticut Personal Data Privacy and Online Monitoring Act.
